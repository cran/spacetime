Questions: (ltraj: ID, burst) -- two levels of ID's?

1. xyz -> mpoint,mreal, OR mpoint?
2. region x point -> point; what is point if they do not intersect? point can be NULL?
3. spatio-temporal indexing to speed up (S/T) queries? S/T tree?
4. space-time prisms, or possibility/probabilities?
5. mbool "moving bool" is, essentially, "changing bool" (change over time)
6. speed: taken from t-1 to t, or t to t+1? How to deal with first or last?

+ a trajectory is not a sequence of (x,y,t) points -- these are the
discrete observations, not the object.
+ focus on current location, or analysis of past trajectories (focus here)
+ moving oints vs moving / evolving regions.

conceptually a moving point into a data type.

f: location (time) -> mpoint (moving point)

trajectory: mpoint -> line.

distance: mpoint x mpoint -> mreal.

movement can be continuous, or discrete -- "my home address"!

guarantee: atinstant(mdist(a,b),t) = mdist(atinstant(a,t),atinst(b,t)) etc.
lifting operations to time-dependent operations.

atinstant (find out where it is, if at all, at t or period [t1,t2], periods...)
 -- whereamI(x,t)?
at (find out whether it is at certain locations, and when)
 -- whenamI(x,at)
